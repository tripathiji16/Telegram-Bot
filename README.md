**Telegram Bot**

**Description**

*Bots are small applications that run entirely within the Telegram app. Users interact with bots through flexible interfaces that can support any kind of task or service. This is my straightforward set of steps to get a responsive telegram bot up and running from scratch*

**Usage**

*1. Create a bot on Telegram Application using BotFather.*

*2. Type /help to see all possible commands the botfather can handle.*

*3. Click on or type /newbot to create a new bot.Follow instructions and make a new name for your bot. If you are making a bot just for experimentation, it can be useful to namespace your bot by placing your name before it in its username, since it has to be a unique name.* 

*4. The newly created token will be used for the following steps.*

*5. Apart from this, 'express' is our application server, 'axios' is an http client, 'body-parser' will help us parse the response body received from each request*

*6. You can run this server on your local machine by running node index.js. If everything goes fine, you should see the message “Telegram app listening on port 3000!” printed on your console.*

*7. We have used Vercel(cloud platform designed to streamline the development, deployment, and scaling of web projects), create your account before execution. Use 'npm install -g vercel' command on terminal for intallation.*

*8. Use the curl command to set up the Telegram webhook, replacing <your_api_token> with your actual Telegram API token and <your_project_url> with the URL- 'curl -F "url=https://<your_project_url>/api/new-message" https://api.telegram.org/bot<your_api_token>/setWebhook'*
